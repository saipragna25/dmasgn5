Problem Using any data set you want, implement colabs for the following ANN algorithms (see hints) - showcase proper metrics for this as well.

Write proper documentation in read.me file and colabs

see my slides for pointers to colabs hints

a) LSH from scratch, Random projections from scratch

FAISS library based or any other popular library based colabs for

b) exhaustive search

c) product quantization

d) trees and graphs

e) hnsw
